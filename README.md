# Georgia-Lottery
This is an Intel x86 assembly language program that simulates the Georgia Lottery. The program contains three procedures and outputs the six possible outcomes based on
what the user enters. Simply enter the six numbers of your choosing between 1 and 47 to test the winning and losing possibilities.

This code was for a lab in the class, CPEN 3710, at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga.
